8 Puzzle Solver Using A* Algorithm  

This Python project implements an 8 Puzzle Solver using the A* (A-star) search algorithm. The program finds the optimal solution to arrange tiles in order, starting from a given initial state. It uses heuristic functions like **Manhattan Distance** to guide the search efficiently.  

Features:  
- Customizable initial and goal states.  
- Clear step-by-step visualization of moves.  
- Compact, easy-to-read codebase.  

Perfect for learning search algorithms and exploring AI problem-solving techniques!
