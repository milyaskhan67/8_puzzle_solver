8 Puzzle Solver Using A* Algorithm with GUI  

This Python project implements an 8 Puzzle Solver with a GUI built using Tkinter. The program utilizes the A* (A-star) search algorithm with Manhattan Distance heuristic to find the optimal solution for arranging tiles in order.  

Features:  
- Interactive GUI for inputting initial and goal states.  
- Real-time visualization of steps and solution process.  
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.  

A great way to explore AI algorithms with a visual and interactive experience!
